## :scroll: Description
This is my implementation of the first Jetpack Compose Android Dev Challenge, Jetpack Compaws!
It displays a list of dogs available for adoption with each being selectable to find out more about them.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I've been using Compose while it's been in alpha, so this was a great chance to put together some of the techniques I've learned previously.
This includes the use of an animated navigation, providing a Crossfade when switching between the list and details view, as well as using decorations on composables such as clipping the images to give them a rounded look.
Also the dogs included in my project are actual dogs available to adopt in the UK right now through the Dogs Trust, a charity I'm particularly fond of as a dog owner.
